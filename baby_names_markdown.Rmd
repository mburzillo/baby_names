## R Markdown

library(tidyverse)

```{r cars}
glimpse(babynames)

babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Maria") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = sex))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
